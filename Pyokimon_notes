Start with two random frogs, both level 1. You can have up to 6 frogs max.

Start the game in the Prepare scene where you can check stats of your frogs, let them go,
or breed any two frogs as long as they are level 2 or higher (Maybe: when you breed frogs,
the two parent frogs stay at the same level as a tradeoff mechanism?) The new frog is generated
deterministically as a function of the parents' id (hash, modulo or something) or completely
random, with a lower chance to get a "rare" frog with high stats. Name and everything could
be randomly rolled just to make it easier.

You can check the stats of your frogs and see their profile pick in the Stats scene.

Once your ready, click "battle" button in the Prepare scene and load Battle scene.
You place each frog in the Area2D Arena scene and once all of your frogs are placed, click
"go" button and the frogs will target, jump and ground pound the nearest frog in order to
try and knock them off the lillypad arena into the water. Last team standing wins.
The PC player will have the same AI and similar frogs +/- some stats to balance difficulty.
Frogs that fall off aren't lost forever. Frogs that stay on will level up and get a stat
boost, and they can breed.

Play until you decide to retire. Show the credits and loop back to main menu.

Stats are:
SPD - speed in targeting and jumping
JMP - max jump distance
STR - alternatively PWR, strength of ground pound and effect on pounded enemy frogs
INT - frogs target with less error in degrees and distance, accuracy essentially, ACC? 
FRG - hit box size decreases
